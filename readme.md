# Keras-llm-robot Web UI

üåç [READ THIS IN CHINESE](readme-cn.md)

The project inherits from the Langchain-Chatchat project(https://github.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat) The underlying architecture uses open-source frameworks such as Langchain and Fastchat, with the top layer implemented in Streamlit. The project is completely open-source, aiming for offline deployment and testing of most open-source models from the Hugging Face website. Additionally, it allows combining multiple models through configuration to achieve multimodal, RAG, Agent, and other functionalities.

## Project Introduction
Consists of three main interfaces: the chat interface for language models, the configuration interface for language models, and the tools and agent interface for auxiliary models.

Chat Interface:
![Image1](./img/WebUI.png)
The language model is the foundation model that can be used in chat mode after loading. It also serves as the brain in multimodal features. Auxiliary models, such as voice, image, and retrieval models, require language models to process their input or output text. The voice model like to ear and mouth, the image model like to eye, and the retrieval model provides long-term memory. The project currently supports dozens of language models.

Configuration Interface:
![Image1](./img/Configuration.png)
Models can be loaded based on requirements, categorized into general, multimodal, special, and online models.

Tools & Agent InterfaceÔºö
![Image1](./img/Tools_Agent.png)
Auxiliary models, such as retrieval, code execution, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, image recognition, and image generation, it can be loaded based on requirements. The tools section includes settings for function calls (requires language model support for function calling).

## Environment Setup

  1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda and Git. Windows users also need to install the CMake tool, Ubuntu users need to install gcc tools.

  ```bash

    ```bash
    # Using libav
    brew install libav

    ####    OR    #####

    # Using ffmpeg
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

  8. If you need to download models from Hugging Face for offline execution, please download the models yourself and place them in the "models" directory. If the models have not been downloaded in advance, the WebUI will automatically download them from the Hugging Face website to the local system cache.
  ```bash
  // such as the folder of llama-2-7b-chat model:
  models\llm\Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

  // such as the folder of XTTS-v2 speech-to-text model:
  models\voices\XTTS-v2

  // such as the folder of faster-whisper-large-v3 text-to-speech model:
  models\voices\faster-whisper-large-v3
  ```

  9. When using the `OpenDalleV1.1` model to generate images, if using 16-bit precision, please download the `sdxl-vae-fp16-fix` model from Huggingface and place it in the `models\imagegeneration` folder. If enabling the Refiner, please download the `stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0` model from Huggingface and place it in the `models\imagegeneration` folder beforehand.

## Feature Overview

### Interface Overview

- #### Configuration Interface

    In the configuration interface, you can choose suitable language models to load, categorized as `Foundation Models`, `Multimodal Models`, `Special Models`, and `Online Models`.

  1. **`Foundation Models`** Untouched models published on Hugging Face, supporting models with chat templates similar to OpenAI.
  2. **`Multimodal Models`** Models supporting both voice and text or image and text at the lower level.
  3. **`Code Models`** Code generation model.
  4. **`Special Models`** Quantized models (GGUF) published on Hugging Face or models requiring special chat templates.
  5. **`Online Models`** Supports online language models from OpenAI and Google, such as GPT4-Turbo, Gemini-Pro, GPT4-vision, and Gemini-Pro-vision. Requires OpenAI API Key and Google API Key, which can be configured in the system environment variables or in the configuration interface.


![Image1](./img/Configuration.png)


- #### Tools & Agent Interface

  In the tools & agent interface, you can load auxiliary models such as retrieval, code execution, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, image recognition, image generation, or function calling.

  1. **`Retrieval`** Supports both local and online vector databases, local and online embedding models, and various document types. Can provide long-term memory for the Foundation model.
  2. **`Code Interpreter`** Supports local interpreter "keras-llm-interpreter".
  3. **`Text-to-Speech`** Supports local model XTTS-v2 and Azure online text-to-speech service. Requires Azure API Key, which can be configured in the system environment variables `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION`, or in the configuration interface.
  4. **`Speech-to-Text`** Supports local models whisper and fast-whisper and Azure online speech-to-text service. Requires Azure API Key, which can be configured in the system environment variables `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION`, or in the configuration interface.
  5. **`Image Recognition`** Supports local model blip-image-captioning-large.
  6. **`Image Generation`** Supports local model OpenDalleV1.1 for static image generation and local model stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt for dynamic image generation.
  7. **`Function Calling`** You can configure function calling to empower models with the ability to use utilities.

  Once the speech-to-text model is loaded, voice and video chat controls will appear in the chat interface. Click the `START` button to record voice via the microphone and the `STOP` button to end the voice recording. The speech model will automatically convert the speech to text and engage in conversation with the language model. When the text-to-speech model is loaded, the text output by the language model will automatically be converted to speech and output through speakers and headphones.

![Image](./img/Chat_by_voice.png)

  Once the Multimodal model is loaded(such as Gemini-Pro-Vision)Ôºåupload controls will appear in the chat interface, The restrictions on uploading files depend on the loaded model. After sending text in the chatbox, both uploaded files and text will be forwarded to the multimodal model for processing.

![Image](./img/Chat_by_upload.png)


- ### Language Model Features

  1. **`Load Model`**
      
      **Foundation Models** can be loaded with CPU or GPU, and with 8-bits loading (`4-bits is invalid`). Set the appropriate CPU Threads to improve token output speed when using CPU. When encountering the error 'Using Exllama backend requires all the modules to be on GPU' while loading the GPTQ model, please add "'disable_exllama': true" in the 'quantization_config' section of the model's config.json.
      
      **Multimodal models** can be loaded with CPU or GPU. For Vision models, users can upload images and text for model interaction. For Voice models, users can interact with the model using a microphone (without the need for auxiliary models). (`Not implemented`)

      **Special models** can be loaded with CPU or GPU, Please prioritize CPU loading of GGUF models.

      **Online models** do not require additional local resources and currently support online language models from OpenAI and Google.


      **`NOTE`** When the TTS library is not installed, XTTS-2 local speech models cannot be loaded, but other online speech services can still be used. If the llama-cpp-python library is not installed, the GGUF model cannot be loaded. Without a GPU device, AWQ and GPTQ models cannot be loaded.

        2. Create local folder for Milvus and copy the file docker-compose.yml into it.

        3. create sub folder conf, db, logs, pic, volumes, wal

        4. Execute the command in that folder
           docker-compose up -d

        5. Please check whether the image deployment is successful in the Docker interface. and ensure that the image is running and listening on ports 19530 and 9091.
      ```

      **`NOTE`** When using the PGVector databaseÔºåit is recommended to deploy it locally using Docker.
      ```bash
        1. Execute the command for download image.
           docker pull ankane/pgvector

        2. Deploy the container using the following command, and modify the DB name, username, and password as needed. (Please also update the 'connection_uri' configuration in kbconfig.json under 'pg').
           docker run --name pgvector -e POSTGRES_DB=keras-llm-robot -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d ankane/pgvector

        3. Please check whether the image deployment is successful in the Docker interface. and ensure that the image is running and listening on ports 5432.
      ```

      As an example with Ubuntu, after successfully launching the server-side of Milvus and PGVector, you can check them in Docker Desktop. Additionally, you can install clients such as attu or pgAdmin to manage vector DB:

      ![Image1](./img/Ubuntu-Docker.png)


      Support the following Documents:

      html, mhtml, md, json, jsonl, csv, pdf, png, jpg, jpeg, bmp, eml, msg, epub, xlsx, xls, xlsd, ipynb, odt, py, rst, rtf, srt, toml, tsv, docx, doc, xml, ppt, pptx, enex, txt

      Knowledge Base Interface:
      ![Image1](./img/KnowledgeBase.png)
      When creating a new knowledge base, please enter the name and introduction of the knowledge base, and select an appropriate vector database and embedding model. If the document content of the knowledge base is in English, it is recommended to choose the local model `bge-large-en-v1.5`; if the content is predominantly in Chinese with some English, it is recommended to choose `bge-large-zh-v1.5` or `m3e-large`.

      Upload Documents Interface:
      ![Image1](./img/Upload_Docs.png)
      You can choose to upload one or multiple documents at a time. During the document upload, content extraction, split, vectorization, and addition to the vector database will be performed. The process may take a considerable amount of time, so please be patient.

      Documents Content Interface:
      ![Image1](./img/Docs_Content.png)
      You can inspect the content of document slices and export them.

      Knowledge Base Chat Interface:
      ![Image1](./img/Knowledge_base_chat.png)
      In the chat interface, you can select a knowledge base, and the Foundation model will answer user queries based on the content within the selected knowledge base.


  2. **`Code Interpreter`**

      Enable code execution capability for the language model to empower it with actionable functionality for the mind.

      Keras-llm-interpreter provides two modes for usage: the first is the local execution mode, which runs code on the local PC, allowing modifications to the local PC environment; the second is the Docker image mode, providing a more secure execution environment as it operates within a sandbox, ensuring that running code does not affect the local PC environment.

      (1) Local Execution Mode

      First, configure the local execution environment:
      ```bash
        pip install ipykernel
        pip install ipython

        python -m ipykernel install --name "python3" --user
      ```

      (2) Docker Image Mode

      Downloading the Docker image:
      ```bash

- ### AI Generator

    We combine various models and tools to create efficient and productive AI agents.

  1. **`Intelligent Customer Service Agent`**

    The design goal of the intelligent customer service agent is to provide users with efficient, personalized, and accurate customer service, thereby improving customer experience and satisfaction. To achieve this goal, intelligent customer service agents typically should possess the following capabilities:

    (1) Natural Language Processing (NLP) Capability: Intelligent customer service agents need to understand user input in natural language, including text, speech, or images. NLP techniques can assist the agent in understanding user intents, questions, or needs.

    (2) Knowledge Base Management Capability: The agent should be able to manage and update a knowledge base, including FAQs, solutions, product information, etc. Continuous updating and optimization of the knowledge base can enhance the agent's accuracy and speed in problem-solving.

    (3) Automatic Response and Routing: The agent should automatically identify user queries and provide relevant responses or route them to appropriate human agents or departments. This helps in reducing user wait times and improving service efficiency.

    (4) Personalized Recommendations and Suggestions: Based on user history and behavior, the agent should offer personalized recommendations and suggestions to help users find solutions or products more quickly.

    (5) Multi-Channel Support: The agent should provide service across various communication channels, including website chat, mobile apps, social media, etc. This ensures meeting user needs across different platforms and maintaining a consistent service experience.

    (6) User Authentication and Data Security: The agent should authenticate users and ensure the security and privacy of user data, thereby building user trust and complying with relevant laws and regulations.


  2. **`Real-time Language Translation Agent`**

    The design goal of the AI real-time language translation agent is to achieve real-time translation between different languages, enabling users to smoothly engage in cross-language communication and interaction. To achieve this goal, AI real-time language translation agents typically should possess the following capabilities:

    (1) Multi-Language Support: The agent should support translation across multiple languages, including common global languages and regional dialects, to cater to diverse user needs.

    (2) Real-time Translation: The agent should translate user input text or speech into the target language in real-time, displaying or playing back the translation promptly to ensure timely and fluent communication.

    (3) High Accuracy: The agent should maintain high translation accuracy, accurately conveying the meaning of the original language and avoiding ambiguity and misunderstandings as much as possible.

    (4) Contextual Understanding: The agent needs to understand the context of the text or speech and translate accordingly to ensure that the translation aligns with the context and effectively communicates the message.

    (5) Speech Recognition and Synthesis: For speech input and output, the agent needs to have speech recognition and synthesis capabilities to enable speech translation functionality.

    (6) Personalization Settings: The agent should allow users to personalize settings according to their preferences and needs, such as selecting preferred languages, adjusting translation speeds, etc.

    (7) Data Security and Privacy Protection: The agent should ensure the security and privacy of user-input text or speech data, adhering to relevant data protection laws and standards.
